To start with, first of all you have to setup the blockchain network. To do such, execute the main.bat file or 
you can edit it to change the parameters according to your need (port number = 4000 and nodeID = ECP01 default).

Implementation on single node and multiple nodes:
If you want to test the API, you can just run multiple nodes on the same PC. And test its endpoint using Postman.
But if you want to implement it over multiple PCs connected over the internet, you can use any tool for exposing
web socekts over the internet. The software we have used is ngrok for making the local node accessible through the
internet.
